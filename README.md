# 🛠️ Spindle Vibration Anomaly Detection in Heavy Milling Machines

This project is a part of the **AI for Manufacturing** course by GTU.

## 📌 Problem Statement

Abnormal spindle vibrations in heavy milling machines can be early indicators of tool misalignment or wear. If not detected in time, these vibrations can lead to severe machine breakdowns and production loss.

## 🎯 Objective

To build an AI-based system that can classify vibration signals as **normal** or **faulty** using sensor data, enabling predictive maintenance.

## 🧠 Methodology

- Simulated vibration data for normal and faulty conditions  
- Preprocessed the data and trained an Isolation Forest anomaly detection model  
- Built a lightweight web app using Streamlit for real-time testing  

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- Python  
- Streamlit  
- NumPy  
- Pandas  
- Scikit-learn (Isolation Forest)  

## 🖥️ How to Run

1. Clone this repository or download the Python file.  
2. Make sure Streamlit is installed:
3. Run the app:
4. The app will open in your browser. Adjust vibration values and see results live.
